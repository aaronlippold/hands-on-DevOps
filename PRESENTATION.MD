## This course will

- Discuss DevOps,
- Have you spin up a DevOps toolchain and development environment, and then
- Author two applications and their accompanying pipelines, the first a continuous integration (CI) and the second a continuous delivery (CD) pipeline.

--

We will be spending most of the course hands-on working with the tools and in the Unix command line making methods and repeated practices of DevOps happen, so as to grow an understanding of how DevOps actually works.

--

Don't fixate on the tools used, nor the apps we develop in the course of learning how and why.  How and why is far more important.  This course like DevOps is not about tools although we'll be using them. You'll spend far more time writing code.  (Or at least cutting-and-pasting code.)

## What you should bring:

- Managing Linux or Unix-like systems as we will living largely within the terminal.
- A basic understanding of Vagrant, Docker, and Ansible would be helpful.
- But mostly being a software engineer.

---

## What is DevOps?

--

DevOps (a clipped compound of the words "development" and "operations") is a software development methodology with an emphasis on a more reliable release pipeline, automation, and stronger collaboration across all stakeholders with the goal of deploying working functionality into the hands of users (i.e., production) faster.

--

Yeah, that's the formal definition.

--

I've grown to prefer the axiom:

*You are what you **code**.*

--

If you're a developer or software engineer, you're at least ***coding*** the application, its build automation, unit tests, and CI/CD (the combined practices of Continuouse Integrarion and Continuous Delivery) automation.

--

If a tester, you're ***coding*** typically the functional test automation.

--

If a security engineer, you're ***coding*** the compliance and policy test automation.

--

If ops, you're ***coding*** the deployment and infrastructure configuration management automation.

--

And since all these disciplines are ***coding***, they're essentially using the same methods and repeated practices to ensure they're producing good code.

--

And they're all collectively doing all this coding left in the delivery pipeline, collaborating and from this springs forth culture.

---

## What DevOps is not

--

DevOps is not entirely about tools.

--

Or as I like to put it, "Its not about the tools."

--

<small>There are countless vendors out there, who want to sell you their crummy tool.</small>

--

DevOps will also not entirely stop all bugs nor all vulnerabilities from making it into production, but that's not really the point.

---

## DevOps is really about

Providing the culture and delivery/release pipeline that once a bug or vulnerability is discovered, the concern can to be quickly remediated and functionality returned back to the user.

---

## How is it related to the Agile?

--

Agile Software Development is an umbrella term for a set of methods and practices based on the [values](http://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/the-agile-manifesto/) and [principles](http://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/) expressed in the Agile Manifesto.

--

Agile Software Development shares the same goal, but DevOps extends Agile methods and practices by adding communication and collaboration between

--

development,

--

quality assurance, and

--

technology operations

--

to ensure software systems are delivered in a rapid, reliable, low-risk manner.

--

For Agile, solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams utilizing the appropriate practices for their context.

--

Again, in DevOps everyone is developing software, so it is my view DevOps builds on Agile.

---

## How do they differ?

--

While Agile Software Development encourages collaboration between cross-functional teams, the focus in DevOps is on the

--

inclusion of analysis,

--

design,

--

development, and

--

quality assurance functionaries as stakeholders into the development effort.

---

## Why?

In Agile Software Development, there is rarely an integration of these individuals outside the immediate application development team with members of technology operations (e.g., network engineers administrators, testers, cyber security engineers.)

---

## What are the principles of DevOps?

--

As DevOps matures, several principles have emerged, namely the necessity for product teams to:

--

Apply holistic thinking to solve problems,

--

Develop and test against production-like environments,

--

Deploy with repeatable, and reliable processes,

--

Remove the drudgery through automation,

--

Validate and monitor operational quality, and

--

Provide rapid, automated feedback to the stakeholders

---

## How is this achieved?

--

Achieved through the repeated practices of Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) often conflated into simply "CI/CD".

--

After tools, this is what is commonly (albeit mistakenly) thought to be the totality of DevOps.

---

## What is Continuous Integration (CI)?

It is a repeated Agile software development practice, lifted specifically from Extreme programming, where members of a development team frequently integrate their work in order to detect integration issues as quickly as possible thereby shifting discovery of issues "left" (i.e., early) in the software release.

--

## How?

Each integration is orchestrated through a CI service/orchestrator (e.g., Jenkins CI, Drone CI, GitLab Runners, Concourse CI) that essentially assembles a build, runs unit and integration tests every time a predetermined trigger has been met; and then reports with immediate feedback.

--

## CI best practices

--

### Utilize a Configuration Management System

For the software's source code, where the mainline (i.e., master branch) is the most the most recent working version, past releases held in branches, and new features not yet merged into the mainline branch being worked on their own branches.

--

### Automate the build

By accompanying build automation (e.g., Gradle, Apache Maven, Make) alongside the source code.

--

### Employ one or more CI services/orchestrators

Perform source code analysis via automate formal code inspection and assessment.

--

### Make builds self-testing

In other words, ingrain testing by including unit and integration tests (e.g., Spock, JUnit, Mockito, SOAPUI, go package *Testing*) with the source code so as to be executed by the build automation to be execute by the CI service.

--

### Never commit broken

Or untested source code to the CMS mainline or otherwise risk breaking a build.

--

### Developers are expected to pre-flight new code

Prior to committing source code in their own workspace.

--

### The CI service/orchestrator provides feedback

On the success or fail of a build integration to all its stakeholders.

---

## What is Continuous Delivery?

--

It is a repeated software development practice of providing a rapid, reliable, low-risk product delivery achieved through automating all facets of building, testing, and deploying software.

--

### Extending Continuous Integration (CI)

With additional stages/steps aimed to provide ongoing validation that a newly assembled software build meets all desired requirements and thereby is releasable.

--

### Consistency

Is achieved through delivering applications into production via individual repeatable pipelines of ingrained system configuration management and testing

---

## But wait. What's a pipeline?

--

A pipeline automates the various stages/steps (e.g., Static Application Security Testing (SAST), build, unit testing, Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST), secure configuration acceptance compliance, integration, function and non-functional testing, delivery, and deployment) to enforce quality conformance.

---

## How is a pipeline manifested?

--

Each delivery pipeline is manifested as **Pipeline as Code** (i.e., software automation) accompanying software's source code in its version control repository.

---

## What underlines all of this?

--

I'd argue, _a ubiquitous access to shared pools of configurable system resources and higher-level services that can be rapidly provisioned with minimal management effort_ without the repeated practices of DevOps will struggle.  Although, it is possible to DevOps on mainframes.

---

## But really why do we automate err. code?

--

In 2001, I think Larry Wall in his 1st edition of *Programming Perl* book put it best with "We will encourage you to develop the three great virtues of a programmer:

--

laziness,

--

impatience, and

--

hubris."

--

### Why do I mention Larry Wall?

--

Well...

--

> _Once you have established yourself as an icon in your field
> it is important that you pay tribute  to some of the great legends that came before you.
> This kind of gesture will create the illusion that youâ€™re still humble
> and serve as a preemptive strike against anyone who has noticed
> what a callus and delusional ass you have become._

--

I kid, but in all serious the sentimanet of this seminal book still holds true.

--

Let me explain.

--

### Laziness

_The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful, and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it. Hence, the first great virtue of a programmer._ (p.609)

--

### Impatience

_The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs, but actually anticipate them. Or at least pretend to. Hence, the second great virtue of a programmer._ (p.608)

--

### Hubris

_Excessive pride, the sort of thing Zeus zaps you for. Also, the quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that other people won't want to say bad things about. Hence, the third great virtue of a programmer._ (p.607)

--

### We automate for

--

Faster, coordinated, repeatable, and therefore more reliable deployments.

--

Discover bugs sooner. Shifting their discovery left in the process.

--

To accelerates the feedback loop between Dev and Ops.

--

Reduce tribal knowledge, where one group or person holds the keys to how things get done. Yep, this is about making us all replaceable.

--

Reduce shadow IT (i.e., hardware or software within an enterprise that is not supported by IT. Just waiting for its day to explode.)

---

## Monitoring

--

Once deployed, the work is done, right?

--

A development team's work is not complete once a product leaves CI/CD and enters production; especially, under DevOps where the development teams include members of operations.

--

### The most important metric

Is working software is the _primary_, but not the only, measure of progress.  The key to successful DevOps is knowing how well the methodology and the software it produces are performing.

--

### An Understanding of Performance

Is achieved by collecting and analyzing data produced by environments used for CI/CD and production.

--

### Establish a baseline Performance

So, that improvements can be gauged and anomalies detected.

--

### Set Reaction Thresholds

To formulate and prioritize reactions weighting factors, such as, the frequency at which an anomaly arises and who is impacted.

--

### Reacting

A reaction could be as simple as operations instructing users through training to not do something that triggers the anomaly, or more ideally, result in an issue being entered into the product's backlog culminating in the development team delivering a fix into production.

--

### Gaps in CI/CD

Monitoring will also inform development teams of gaps in CI/CD resulting in additional testing for the issue that triggered the necessity for the improvement.

--

### Eliminating Waste

Further, monitoring may result in the re-scoping of requirements, re-prioritizing of a backlog, or the deprecation of un-used features.

---

## What is DevOps Culture?

--

> **culture** noun  \ *ËˆkÉ™l-chÉ™r* \
> the set of shared attitudes, values, goals, and practices that characterizes an institution or
> organization

--

Now that everyone is a coder using the same tools, methods and repeated practices for their particular discipline you have the foundations of a ***culture***.

--

## Let's unpack the ramifications of this.

--

### We were taught the requisite skills as children

--

--

### Maintaining relationships is your most important skill

### Be quick... Be slow to...

--

### The pressures of social media

---

## Crawl, Walk, Run

<small>Like with almost everything.</small>

--

### Ultimately, DevOps is Goal

--

With DevOps one does not simply hit the ground running.

--

One must first crawl, walk and then ultimately run as you embrace the necessary culture change, methods and repeated practices.

--

Collaboration and automation are expected continually improve so to achieve more frequent and more reliable releases.
